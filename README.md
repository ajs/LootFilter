Loot filter for PoE Beta 2.0

HOW TO ADD TO Path Of Exile under Windows (be aware just downloading the file may add a ".txt" extension which will cause you all kinds of problems. Follow the instructions carefully)

1) Download the desired filter.

2) Assuming your browser saves to a Downloads folder, type the Windows menu key, then "cmd.exe" and enter. This should give you a command shell.

3) `cp "Downloads\leveling.filter" "Documents\my games\Path of Exile\leveling.filter"`

4) If that command fails, try putting ".txt" after the *first* filename (not the second) in the above command.

5) Log out (you don't have to exit) and back in then select the character you want to use the filter on.
  
6) Esc > Options

7) GO to UI tab, at the bottom select the filter, once it says "Filter loaded successfully" no restart required, you are good to go

8) Any updates to the filter can be reloaded without restarting the game by clicking the "reload" button in options


For MacOS, the process is very similar, but MacOS won't be so aggressive about renaming the file, so just download via the browser and use the finder to move it to your Path of Exile folder.
